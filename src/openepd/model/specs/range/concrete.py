    Cement grouting is a slurry that is placed as a flowable liquid. It is an effective material
    for filling and strengthening granular soils, voids in rocks, foundation underpinnings, and
    other underground voids. Also called structural grout, these materials typically impart

    Flowable fill performance specification.

    Flowable fill is a slurry that is placed as a flowable liquid (high slump) and sets with no
    compaction. It is often used in tight or restricted access areas where placing and compacting
    fill is difficult. Applications include filling large voids such as abandoned underground storage
    tanks, basements, tunnels, mines, and sewers. It can also be used as paving sub-base, bridge
    abutment, and retaining wall backfill.

    Also called Controlled Density Fill (CDF) or Controlled Low Strength Materials (CLSMs). These materials typically
    have compressive strengths under 1200 psi.
