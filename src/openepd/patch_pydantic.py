def patch_pydantic_metaclass():
    """
    Patch pydantic's ModelMetaclass to restore class attribute lookup for fields.

    In pydantic, while the model fields are defined in the model as class-level attributes, in runtime they disappear
    due to ModelMetaclass logic. ModelMetaclass takes the defined attributes, removes them from class dict and puts
    into a special __fields__ attribute to avoid naming conflict.

    We would like to be able to access the attributes via dot notation in the runtimes, since it makes refactoring
    easier.

    This class exposes the original fields when accessed via class name. For example, one can call `Pcr.name` and get
    `ModelField`, in addition to calling `pcr.__fields__` on an instance.

    Patch the internal validator function used during model construction to support modified metaclass.

    Pydantic has a special guard which stops execution if a model defines field which shadows a basemodel interface.
    For example, if someone would define a field named `__fields__` this would break code.

    With the modified metaclass functionality, we are exposing the original fields as class attributes, and this
    breaks this check.

    This patcher method modifies the pydantic internals so that the check is retained, but it is not causing exception
    when doing the normal field inheritance.
